# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! üëã

## About Me
I'm a computer engineering enthusiast and academic, with a keen interest in electronics and programming. My GitHub hosts a range of works, from coursework to individual explorations into the world of programming and development.

## Academic Projects
- **Alquilapp:** üöóüì± **[Alquilapp](https://github.com/JeronimoLam/Alquilapp)** - Alquilapp is a project for "Software Engineering" course in the Computer Engineering career. It's an hourly car rental mobile and web app showing available cars on a list and map, with sections for administrators and supervisors.
- **Taller de Proyecto 1:** üì∑ü§ñ [ObservAR](https://github.com/laureanobruno/ObservAR) - The "ObservAR" project aims to create a robust system utilizing a robotic arm for precise image recognition and object tracking, geared towards applications in automation, medical assistance, and security. It integrates various modules for detection, tracking, and power management, facilitating communication between EDU-CIAA and ESP32-CAM boards for stable object tracking using a specialized dataset.
- **Taller de Proyecto 2:** üïπÔ∏èüöó [VR Car with ESP32 CAM](https://github.com/tpII/2023-A1-VR-ESP32CAM)  - The project involves creating an autonomous vehicle controlled via keyboard, featuring dual cameras on a robotic arm, streaming to VR goggles. Head movements detected by the goggles move the arm, enhancing the immersive driving experience. It integrates MQTT, webserver technologies, ESP32 modules, and custom PCBs.

## Research Work (III-LIDI)
- **SPP (Supervised Professional Practice) - 2024:** üìë [Optimized Floyd-Warshall C Library](https://github.com/JeronimoLam/PPS-FloydWarshallLib) - Parallel Floyd-Warshall Lib is a high-performance, multi-threaded library for computing shortest paths in weighted graphs using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm. Optimized for multicore processors, it offers significant speed improvements and scalability. Designed for easy integration, it includes comprehensive documentation and usage examples.

## ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest) 
- **[ICPC-Training-Hub](https://github.com/JeronimoLam/ICPC-Training-Hub):** A group hub for ICPC contest training with practice problems and resources.

## Own Developments
- **[CDyM-LDR](https://github.com/JeronimoLam/CDyM-LDR)**: A comprehensive toolkit for creating and managing digital circuits and microcontroller projects.
- **[ESP32cam_PanTilt](https://github.com/JeronimoLam/ESP32cam_PanTilt)**: Advanced C++ application for precision pan-tilt control of ESP32 cameras.
- **[First_Landing_Page](https://github.com/JeronimoLam/First_Landing_Page)**: A sleek, responsive HTML landing page designed for engaging user experiences.
